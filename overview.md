# UI
### Objective
Create a modular front end to work with each back end. The front end should protect from SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and password validation issues. For this reason, we run the front end as a desktop application with secure communication to the backend. The front end must also be visually appealing and easy to use. 

### Process
The Front end had three design phases: design, implementation, and testing. During the design phase, we completed mock-ups for potential application designs. For the implementation phase, we broke up into Mobile and Desktop teams. The Mobile team worked towards a proof-of-concept to show that voting from home could be viable in the future. The Desktop team worked towards creating a secure application that can connect to the backend and register votes. During the testing phase, we ran test-votes and made sure that all of the information was taken from the backend correctly, displayed well, gathered voter information correctly, and sent that information back to the backend efficiently. On top of these three design phases, we also created a website for the class and created an administrator app to enter in voting data and facilitate launching multiple voting applications.

### Results
We have a functioning desktop app and a proof of concept for the mobile app. For each implementation, the user can log in with a passcode or a QR code. After that, they can easily move around the ballot without losing their place or accidentally skipping a vote. The administrator app is currently just a mode for demonstrating these features from the backend as well as facilitating the demonstration of the features of each backend. With some additional work, these could be spun out into a viable voting mechanism. More testing would be needed in conjunction with the backend to ensure the success of the system as a whole. In future iterations of the work, you could potentially see who you voted for, however there is concerns with this kind of implementation. 

### Conclusion
The UI team created multiple apps to show the functionality of each backend in a clear and easy-to-use way. The desktop app being the main center peice, it allows our users to cast a vote and see that it was counted. The mobile app serves as a proof-of-concept that such an app could be used to vote from home utilizing the security and trust that a blockchain gives.
